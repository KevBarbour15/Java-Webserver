*** Introduction *** 

This Java Web Server is a lightweight, configurable server designed to handle HTTP requests.
 It's built using Java with customizability and ease of use in mind. This server parses configuration 
 and MIME type files to dynamically handle requests.

*** Requirements ***

Java (recommended version: Java 11 or higher)
Any additional libraries (if used) should be listed here
Installation

Clone or download the source code from the repository.
Navigate to the directory containing WebServer.java.

*** Configuration ***

***IMPORTANT***
Before running the server, ensure that you have configured the following:

Edit the httpd.conf file to set server configurations like port, document root, etc. Absolute paths to
these files on your system are a must or it will not run. Additionally, navigate to the protected file 
.../server/public_html/protected/ and change the AuthUserFile in the .htaccess file to the absolute path 
of the .htpasswd file. 

The username/password for the protected page:
username: nuggets
password: champs2023!

*** Running The Server *** 

Navigate to the root folder and compile the server code using the Java compiler:

```javac WebServer.java```

Start the server with:

```java WebServer```

In the terminal you should see "Starting WebServer" 

After starting the server, you can navigate to localhost:8096 (or the configured port in the 
httpd.conf file) in your web browser to access the server.

From there you should see random various tests to ensure that the server works as designed.

To stop the server, hit control + c. 

To delete all the classes type in the terminal: 
```find . -name "*.class" -type f -delete```
